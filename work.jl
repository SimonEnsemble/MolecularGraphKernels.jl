# Bullet Point 3

	employ CSI kernel to create Gram matrix for cannabanoids. use diffusion map with custom kernel matrix (see here¬≤ for package) to embed into 2D space. create function that will color the points according to a given label (what proteins they bind to) to see if the clustering can pick up on this. (even if nothing comes of this, great way to quickly get your workflow running/figure out how diffusion maps work/ what they are doing/benchmark your Gram matrix. how much time does it take to compute the Gram matrix?)

	search the literature to answer:
		
	1. is finding the largest common subgraph still a proper kernel? i.e positive semi-definite? not clear to me that it is. look in reviews of graph kernels, to see if they discuss anything like this. or on grakel page? [answer = no, below. so we shouldn't use that.]
		
	2. what prediction tasks have used the common subgraph isomorphism kernel? what are the size of the graphs/number of graphs? keep these papers handy so that you can cite them in your paper. good way to find out = look at the citations to the subgraph matching kernel paper. but also Google Scholar search for common subgraph isomorphism kernel (been around longer).

# Bullet Point 5

	Sec. 3.3.1 of subgraph matching kernel paper here, "Restriction to Subgraph Classes", paragraph 2. the algorithm can be made faster and perhaps make for a more reasonable kernel (similarity description) by only looking at cliques spanned by c-edges. this is done on-the-fly when enumerating the cliques, not after the cliques are detected with post-filtering. "only enumerate c-cliques by making sure that only vertices are added that are adjacent to a vertex in the current clique via at least one c-edge". so when u try to extend a current clique into a maximal clique, you check if the new potential vertex is connected via a c-edge to one of the vertices in the current (possibly, non-maximum) clique. so Xiaoli was right. this is a simple modification of the clique enumeration algorithm and worth implementing. instead of inventing your own clique detection algorithm, I think you should use an algorithm that is already out there, e.g the Bron‚ÄìKerbosch algorithm.¬≥

	what does Graphs.jl use for clique detection? is it Bron-Kerbosch? you can look at the maximal_cliques algorithm to see. the above implementation could be, copying their code, then only extending the clique if the new proposed vertex is connected to current clique by a c-edge. or at least taking inspiration from their code already to enumerate your own cliques.

!!! note
	Requiring that an MPG clique be spanned by c-edges vastly reduces the search space, but the overall complexity is still pretty bad.  The MPG of two graphs with size ``n`` has a maximum size of ``n!``, and clique enumeration on a graph of ``N`` nodes has worst-case complexity ``\mathcal{O}(N^k)`` given maximum clique size ``k``.  That means clique enumeration on the MPG is at worst ``\mathcal{O}(n!^n)`` (in the case of comparing a complete graph with itself).  Constraining cliques by growing only along c-edge subgraphs may make this better, but almost anything would be...

# Bullet Point 9

	The 2D graph kernel is based on the concept of the maximum common subgraph (MCS) of two graphs. Since determining a MCS is NP-complete, exact algorithms that guarantee to return an optimal solution are too time-consuming for large data sets of graphs of even moderate size. We therefore resort to approximate solutions using the graduate assignment algorithm. (33) Since the proposed graph kernel is not positive semidefinite...‚Å¥
